FUxCon 2013 // Django
======================

Implementation of a project site as demonstrated at the FUxCon 2013 workshop.
This particular implementation is based on Django 1.5 which gets installed into 
a virtualenv during installation.

As a quick start, 

1. Set up a MySQL database "fuxcon2013_django" and create a database user "fuxcon" with password "fuxcon" for it.

2. Run the script install.sh in this directory. 

3. Set up a web server with UWSGI and Python and point its document root at 

  <this directory>

4. Access the website through your browser 

Please refer to our website http://cocomore.github.io/fuxcon2013 for background information. You may also want to try the disk image with a minimal Debian Linux system we provide through this website. This image has all four framework implementations and all necessary software pre-installed.

Happy coding,
Olav Schettler // Cocomore AG
